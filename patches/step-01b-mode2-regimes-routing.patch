+# Regime Taxonomy (Micro 1-20m) -- CANONICAL
+
+## Purpose
+- Provide a deterministic per-symbol market-context label used to gate entries and select a setup menu.
+- Tighten-only: under uncertainty, BLOCK/THROTTLE entries; exits allowed.
+
+## Output Contract (regime classifier)
+- MUST output:
+  - `core_regime in {TREND, RANGE, BREAKOUT, MEAN_REV, CHAOTIC_AVOID, UNKNOWN}`
+  - `regime_confidence` (monotone score; no new numeric thresholds here)
+  - `regime_conflict_flag` (TRUE/FALSE)
+- Meaning:
+  - `regime_conflict_flag=TRUE` when higher-TF context materially disagrees with lower-TF micro context, OR when data quality / micro sanity is degraded.
+
+## Overlay Alignment (Minimal Regime Taxonomy)
+- Overlay minimal taxonomy: Trend, Range, Chop/Noise, High-Vol Expansion, Low-Vol Compression, Shock/Dislocation.
+- Mapping (tighten-only; if unclear -> `UNKNOWN`):
+  - Trend -> `core_regime=TREND`
+  - Range -> `core_regime=RANGE`
+  - Chop/Noise -> typically `core_regime=UNKNOWN` (or `MEAN_REV` only when a clear anchor/mean exists)
+  - Low-Vol Compression -> typically:
+    - `core_regime=RANGE` (compression inside a range), OR
+    - pre-condition for `core_regime=BREAKOUT` (compression resolving)
+  - High-Vol Expansion -> typically:
+    - `core_regime=BREAKOUT` (expansion with follow-through), OR
+    - `core_regime=TREND` (trend acceleration) ONLY if structure stays orderly
+  - Shock/Dislocation -> `core_regime=CHAOTIC_AVOID` (entries blocked; exits allowed)
+
+## Precedence (MUST)
+1) Readiness/Health gates (if NOT OK -> entries blocked; exits allowed)
+2) Shock/Dislocation override (`CHAOTIC_AVOID`)
+3) Regime classification (only if not in shock)
+4) If conflict or low confidence -> `UNKNOWN` (tighten-only)
+
+## The 6 Regimes (definitions; no numeric thresholds)
+
+### 1) TREND
+- Directional structure is stable and persistent; pullbacks are orderly; continuation is plausible.
+- “Orderly” means: swings are legible, breaks do not instantly revert, and micro sanity is not degraded.
+- Typical routing: TREND menu (trend continuation / pullback-into-trend).
+
+### 2) RANGE
+- Boundaries are respected; rotations are orderly; break attempts tend to fail or revert.
+- Range can include low-vol compression without implying an imminent breakout.
+- Typical routing: RANGE menu (range rotation / strict boundary rejection).
+
+### 3) BREAKOUT
+- Compression resolves into expansion with follow-through; structure breaks and holds with persistence.
+- Distinction vs TREND:
+  - BREAKOUT: transition phase (break + hold + follow-through), often after compression.
+  - TREND: established directional structure (continuation/pullback framing dominates).
+- Typical routing: BREAKOUT menu (breakout + retest + go; structured momentum).
+
+### 4) MEAN_REV
+- Short impulses overextend and revert toward an anchor/mean; trend-follow edges are weak.
+- Distinction vs RANGE:
+  - MEAN_REV: a clear “anchor/mean” exists and price repeatedly reverts toward it.
+  - RANGE: boundaries/rotation dominate even if an anchor is less explicit.
+- Typical routing: MEAN_REV menu (VWAP/anchor fade, EMA mean fade, range extremes fade).
+
+### 5) CHAOTIC_AVOID (Shock/Dislocation)
+- Microstructure is unstable (liquidity fragility / dislocation) OR event shock conditions active.
+- Rule: entries BLOCKED; exits/reductions allowed.
+- Router MUST return `route_mode=AVOID` and `entry_policy=BLOCK`.
+
+### 6) UNKNOWN
+- Triggered when:
+  - `regime_conflict_flag=TRUE`, OR
+  - regime confidence is low / classification ambiguous, OR
+  - repeated regime flip-flops are observed (unstable environment), OR
+  - Chop/Noise dominates (low clarity), OR
+  - inputs are present but not decision-grade (quality degraded without full shock).
+- Rule: entries BLOCKED by default (or strict THROTTLE only with an explicit documented plan); exits allowed.
+
+## Transitions (tighten-only; no numeric thresholds)
+- Use hysteresis + persistence windows:
+  - A regime label MAY change only after stability persists long enough AND the prior label is invalidated long enough.
+- Prevent flip-flop:
+  - repeated switching -> force `UNKNOWN` (tighten-only).
+- Shock recovery bias:
+  - after `CHAOTIC_AVOID`, require stability before resuming normal routing; do not assume normal immediately.
+- If any transition logic is unclear/missing -> [INBOX-REVIEW] and default stricter (UNKNOWN/AVOID entry blocking).
+
+## Notes
+- This file defines the regime labels and their intent.

+# Router Eligibility Policy -- CANONICAL (Micro 1-20m)
+
+## Purpose
+- Deterministically map (Readiness/Health, Regime, Winning Bias, instrument capability, micro sanity) to:
+  - allowed setup families
+  - an entry permissioning policy
+- Router does NOT override invariants. It only tightens.
+
+## Router Output Contract
+- MUST output:
+  - `route_mode in {TREND, RANGE, BREAKOUT, MEAN_REV, AVOID, UNKNOWN}`
+  - `allowed_setup_families` (explicit list)
+  - `entry_policy in {ALLOW, THROTTLE, BLOCK}`
+
+## Router Eligibility (MUST pass before any entry)
+If ANY condition fails -> `entry_policy=BLOCK` (entries blocked; exits allowed):
+
+1) Readiness/Health PASS
+- If NOT PASS -> BLOCK entries.
+
+2) Data Quality OK
+- No missing/stale critical inputs; no gappy bars on required TFs.
+- If degraded -> BLOCK entries.
+
+3) Micro Sanity PASS
+- Spread/impact/quote quality not in shock/degraded state.
+- If degraded -> BLOCK entries.
+
+4) Shock/Dislocation Override
+- If active -> `route_mode=AVOID`, `entry_policy=BLOCK`.
+
+5) Unknown / Conflict Handling
+- If `core_regime=UNKNOWN` OR `regime_conflict_flag=TRUE` -> default `route_mode=UNKNOWN`, `entry_policy=BLOCK`.
+- Exception: strict THROTTLE is allowed ONLY if an explicit "Unknown-Mode throttle" plan is documented elsewhere; never loosen gates.
+
+6) Capability Gates (instrument/venue)
+- If shorting is disallowed -> router MUST NOT allow net-short entry families.
+- If other capability constraints exist -> restrict allowed families accordingly.
+
+## Default Routing (conservative)
+- If `core_regime=CHAOTIC_AVOID` -> `route_mode=AVOID`, `entry_policy=BLOCK`, `allowed_setup_families=[]`
+- If `core_regime=UNKNOWN` -> `route_mode=UNKNOWN`, `entry_policy=BLOCK` (default), `allowed_setup_families=[]`
+
+Otherwise (eligible):
+
+- core_regime=TREND
+  - `route_mode=TREND`
+  - allow TREND families only (trend continuation / pullback-into-trend) aligned with Winning Bias.
+  - If routing begins to flip-flop or structure stops being orderly -> tighten to UNKNOWN/BLOCK.
+
+- core_regime=RANGE
+  - `route_mode=RANGE`
+  - allow RANGE families (range rotation / strict boundary rejection).
+  - If Chop/Noise dominates (low clarity / frequent false moves) -> tighten to UNKNOWN/BLOCK.
+
+- core_regime=BREAKOUT
+  - `route_mode=BREAKOUT`
+  - allow breakout/momentum families (breakout + retest + go; compression breakout).
+  - If the “break” is not holding (false breaks / instant reverts) -> tighten to UNKNOWN/BLOCK.
+
+- core_regime=MEAN_REV
+  - `route_mode=MEAN_REV`
+  - allow mean-reversion families (VWAP/anchor fade, EMA mean fade, range extremes fade).
+  - If a clear anchor/mean is not present -> tighten to RANGE or UNKNOWN (default stricter).
+
+## Counter-bias / Counter-regime Rules (MUST)
+- No counter-bias entries by default.
+- No counter-regime entries by default:
+  - Example: do not run MEAN_REV inside TREND unless explicitly defined AND independently edge-positive > friction AND does not violate invariants.
+- If bias is WEAK/NEUTRAL or `bias_conflict_flag=TRUE` -> tighten: THROTTLE/BLOCK entries (default stricter).
+
+## Re-routing / Flip-flop Protection (SHOULD)
+- Prefer persistence/hysteresis: avoid frequent route changes.
+- If routing flips repeatedly -> treat as UNKNOWN and BLOCK entries by default.

+# Unknown Mode -- CANONICAL (Tighten-only)
+
+## Purpose
+- Define how the system behaves when regime/bias/context is ambiguous or conflicting.
+- Unknown-Mode is a safety state: default to protecting capital and reducing exposure to noise/fakeouts.
+
+## When Unknown-Mode is triggered (any of the following)
+- `core_regime=UNKNOWN`
+- `regime_conflict_flag=TRUE`
+- Low regime confidence / ambiguous classification
+- Repeated regime or router flip-flops (unstable context)
+- Bias conflict (`bias_conflict_flag=TRUE`) that makes entries non-tradeable
+- Data quality or micro sanity degradation that invalidates decision inputs
+- Chop/Noise dominates (low clarity) and no stable routing is defensible
+
+## Default Behavior (MUST)
+- Entries: BLOCK by default.
+- Exits/reductions: ALWAYS allowed.
+- Router: `route_mode=UNKNOWN` and `entry_policy=BLOCK` by default.
+
+## Escalation Rule (MUST)
+- If Unknown-Mode is triggered due to liquidity fragility / dislocation symptoms (even without a formal shock flag),
+  escalate to AVOID behavior:
+  - `route_mode=AVOID`, `entry_policy=BLOCK`
+  - exits/reductions allowed (reduce-first)
+
+## Strict Throttle Exception (MAY, but only if explicitly documented)
+Unknown-Mode may allow strict THROTTLE ONLY when:
+- A documented "Unknown-Mode throttle" plan exists (where it lives must be explicit),
+- It does not violate readiness/health/shock constraints,
+- It does not loosen confirmation or edge-positive requirements,
+- It uses reduce-first management and conservative frequency.
+
+If the plan is missing -> [INBOX-REVIEW] and keep BLOCK default.
+
+## Re-entry Conditions (tighten-only; no numeric thresholds)
+Return to normal routing ONLY when:
+- Conflicts clear (`regime_conflict_flag=FALSE` and `bias_conflict_flag=FALSE`),
+- Data quality and micro sanity are healthy,
+- Regime/routing becomes stable for a persistence window (do not invent numbers here),
+- Shock/Dislocation is not active.
+
+## Operational Notes
