1.0 Purpose
- State high-level risk objectives for micro trading.

1.1 Inputs / Dependencies
- Overall risk appetite; edge-positive gate; robustness state; bias/regime.

1.2 Rules (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- MUST prioritize capital preservation; entries require edge-positive and readiness.
- SHOULD limit exposure duration to 1–20m targets; reduce when conditions drift.
- MAY adjust position sizing rules via separate risk module (not defined here) provided invariants remain.

1.3 Edge Cases / Conflicts
- If objectives conflict with bias-driven opportunities ? objectives win; reduce/exit first.

1.4 Examples (minimal, conceptual)
- Seeking small, repeatable edges with controlled downside per trade and session.

1.5 Open Questions
- [INBOX-REVIEW] Specific risk metrics (e.g., max draw per session) to adopt.
