1.1 Terms
- Winning Bias: current favored side (Long or Short) determined by bias system.
- Edge-positive: trade expectation net of friction is positive; if undefined -> [INBOX-REVIEW].
- Unknown-Mode: state when regime/confidence/health unclear; entries blocked or heavily throttled.
- Confirmation: persistence + confirming candle quality + micro hygiene checks on closed bars.
- Robustness gating: readiness/health controls that can block entries; exits/reductions always allowed.

1.2 Open Questions
