# 99 — Appendix (Glossary, Matrix, Provenance)

## Overview Block
- Mission: Provide provenance, glossary, and comparison matrix; keep trusted sources advisory-only.
- Use when: You want definitions, conflict resolution provenance, or source citations.
- Hard constraints (never override): Advisory cannot override invariants; no numeric thresholds unless already present locally.
- Inputs/Dependencies:
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/99_Appendix/01_Knowledge_Comparison_Matrix.md` (migration source)
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/99_Appendix/02_Trusted_Online_Pack.md` (migration source)
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/01_Foundations/03_Definitions_Glossary.md` (migration source)
- Outputs/Decisions: Clean definitions; traceable rationale; conflict notes.
- Failure modes: Treating advisory as canon; prevented by labeling and precedence rules.
- Non-goals: Turning appendix into strategy rules.
