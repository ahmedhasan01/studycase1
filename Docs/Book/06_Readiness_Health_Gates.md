# 06 — Readiness and Health Gates

## Overview Block
- Mission: Define the gate that can reduce allowed activity to zero entries while keeping exits allowed.
- Use when: Before ANY entry; during shocks; when conflicts arise.
- Hard constraints (never override): “block entries / exits allowed” under degraded readiness.
- Inputs/Dependencies:
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/08_Operational_Robustness/01_Readiness_and_Health_Gates.md` (migration source)
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/08_Operational_Robustness/03_Failure_Modes_and_Emergency_Actions.md` (migration source)
- Outputs/Decisions: Ready / Not Ready; Unknown-Mode triggers; emergency actions and recovery.
- Failure modes: Trading while blind; prevented by strict gating and clear abort paths.
- Non-goals: Venue-specific incident response.
