# 01 — Principles and Scope

## Overview Block
- Mission: Define what this universe is, what it is not, and what rules are non-negotiable.
- Use when: You need the “why/what/limits” before touching setups or execution.
- Hard constraints (never override): Invariants + precedence ladder from overlay; robustness gating.
- Inputs/Dependencies:
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/00_AI_RULES_MICRO_HEIST.md`
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/01_Foundations/04_Core_Invariants.md` (migration source)
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/01_Foundations/03_Definitions_Glossary.md` (migration source)
- Outputs/Decisions: Clear scope, definitions, invariants, and what constitutes a VALID trade.
- Failure modes: Ambiguous terminology; solved by canonical glossary + single-source-of-truth.
- Non-goals: Adding numeric thresholds; use `[INBOX-REVIEW]` if missing.
