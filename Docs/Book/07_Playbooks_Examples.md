# 07 — Playbooks and Examples

## Overview Block
- Mission: Turn canon rules into short operational playbooks (Trigger → Checks → Action → Abort → Notes).
- Use when: You need “what do I do now?” under time pressure.
- Hard constraints (never override): Playbooks reference canon; they do not invent rules.
- Inputs/Dependencies:
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/10_Playbook/01_Micro_Trade_Playbook.md` (one-page canon)
  - `Docs/Micro_Heist_Tree/10_Playbook/00_Runtime_Runbook_One_Page.md` (ops)
- Outputs/Decisions: Rapid, consistent actions; reduced cognitive load.
- Failure modes: Overfitting playbooks; prevented by referencing canon and keeping them short.
- Non-goals: Expanding playbook into a rulebook.
