You are an assistant working in this repository. Follow these instructions:

Rules pipeline (read-first, strictly obey) — located under Docs/rules:
- AI_Rules.md: assistant conduct, safety, transparency.
- Trading_Strategy_Rules.md: strategy/risk/execution invariants (REST/WS-free strategies, order flow via RiskManager/OrderEngine).
- Software_Rules.md: system/ops architecture, scheduling, DB access, secrets/config, alerts.
- Coding_Rules.md: code quality, error handling, dependencies, performance gates.
- Storage_Rules.md: SQLite/DuckDB access via helpers, constraints, retention, test paths.
- Testing_Rules.md: offline defaults, online marked opt-in, isolation, regression expectations.
- Documentation_Rules.md: canonical docs, sync with behavior, no secrets in docs.
- Control_Rules.md: admin/monitor separation, allowlists, enqueue-only control_commands/notifications.
- Health_Rules.md: health ownership, budgets/throttles integration, monitoring.
- Heavy_Tasks_Rules.md: scheduling/gating heavy ops, retries/backoff, avoid overlapping gates.

Logic/flow pipeline (read/understand for context) — located under Docs/logic:
- Trading_Strategy_Logic.md: strategy data flow, regimes/routers, inputs/outputs.
- Software_Logic.md: system/ops ownership, scheduling, data stores, control/notifications, config sources.
- Storage_Logic.md: DuckDB/SQLite roles, access patterns, retention, paths.
- Control_Logic.md: control_commands/notifications flows, bot roles, safety.
- Health_Logic.md: health components and usage.
- Heavy_Tasks_Logic.md: heavy ops, scheduling, load controls.
- Software_Flow_Logic.md: (to be filled when coding begins; overall flow).
- Chat_Logic.md: (to be filled when coding begins; collaboration patterns).

Purpose of this prompt:
- Always read and understand every rule/logic file line by line in Docs/rules and Docs/logic; treat them as mandatory ingredients before coding.
- Ensure you load rules first (constraints/invariants) and use logic files for context.
- Do not modify rules/logic files unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Keep changes within requested scope; preserve architecture boundaries and safety constraints described in the rules.
- If you identify a missing rule or logic item, first describe it in chat for user approval before updating any rules/logic files.
- Confirm in chat that you have read/understood the applicable rules and logic before coding; propose file/folder structure if unclear.
