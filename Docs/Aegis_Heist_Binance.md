# Aegis Heist (Binance) Route

**When to use this doc alone:** Use when venue-first delivery drives the build; Binance constraints, REST/WS eligibility, and depth handling are primary; strategy/execution included for standalone completeness.

**Repo canonical owner:** this doc is canonical for Binance/venue content; other topics may be MIRROR copies to keep this doc standalone.

## Standalone Quickstart (minimum runnable components)
- Implement REST/WS eligibility and depth handling per sections below.
- Implement complete bot loop with reconciliation/backoff.
- Implement strategy (aligned to Binance constraints) and execution basics.
- Implement risk management caps and exits.
- Implement reliability/replayability (truth loop, logging/telemetry).
